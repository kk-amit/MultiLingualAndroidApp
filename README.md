# Multi-Lingual Sample App     
	
This is the Sample Project for Multi-lingual Functionality in Android application. 

Using this sample project you can perform the following operations in context of Multi-language.

1 - Select Language on App Startup.

2 - Change Language in middle.

3 - Unit testing with mockito and check the code coverage.

For this sample application, I am using MVP pattern with Dagger 2 Library. Also, I have used Mockito for unit testing and in this sample application presenters are 100% unit testable(Check the attached code coverage screen-shot).  	
	
As per requirement I have created the list and attached the screen-shot
